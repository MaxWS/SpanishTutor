Project brief

Title: Spanish Classes Tutor

Introduction: This Project is a website for a Freelancer Spanish Tutor, but can be used for any professional offering specific services. I designed and developed the entire project myself. I used minimal and state of the art design, inspired by magazine layout design. The website displays information about the tutor, the service offered and contact details. The entire website UI was done using 'Grid-CSS', 'CSS Flex-box', 'Google Fonts' and 'Font Awesome'.

Technologies: 
* Grid-CSS
* CSS Flex-box
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome
